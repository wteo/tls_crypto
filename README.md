## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through the platform to explore various cryptocurrency resources organized under categories and groups.
- **Link Aggregation**: Users can submit links to external resources, categorizing them under specific cryptocurrencies or broader topics.
- **Accessing Admin**: To access the admin side of the platform, navigate to `<domain>/login`. There is no visible login button on the main interface to keep the admin side discreet. This is intentional, as the admin is designed only for those who wish to participate and contribute to this project. 
- **Manage Content**: Once logged in as an admin or content manager, you can add, edit, or delete categories, groups, and resources as needed.


## Project Overview

TLS Crypto Hub is structured around a hierarchical organization of cryptocurrency resources, following the breadcrumb trail of `Category > Group > Coin/Token > Resources`. Here's a breakdown of this structure:

### 1. Category

- **Description**: Categories are the highest level of organization and represent broad classifications of cryptocurrencies or related topics. Examples include "Platform", "Digital Coin", "DeFi", and "Meme Coins".
- **Implementation**: Categories are defined in the `models` directory, specifically in the `category.js` model. They are managed through the corresponding controller in the `controllers` directory.

### 2. Group

- **Description**: Groups are subdivisions within a category, providing a more granular classification. For instance, under the "Platform" category, you might have groups like "Ethereum-based", "Binance Smart Chain-based", etc.
- **Implementation**: Groups are associated with a specific category and are defined in the `models` directory, in the `group.js` model. They are managed through the corresponding controller.

### 3. Coin/Token

- **Description**: Coins or tokens are individual cryptocurrency entities. Each coin/token belongs to a specific group. Examples include "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Dogecoin", etc.
- **Implementation**: Coins are associated with a specific group and are defined in the `models` directory, in the `coin.js` model. They are managed through the corresponding controller.

### 4. Resources

- **Description**: Resources are external links or references associated with a specific coin/token. These can be links to official websites, whitepapers, community forums, or any other relevant external content.
- **Implementation**: Resources are associated with a specific coin/token and are defined in the `models` directory, in the `resource.js` model. They are managed through the corresponding controller.


## Future Enhancements

- **Rate & Review**: A feature to allow users to rate and review linked resources, fostering a community-driven approach to content discovery, is planned for future releases.


## Known Issues

1. **URL Encoding**: Some forms include inputs that are incorporated into the URL of sub-pages. Adding special characters like "?" in these fields can disrupt the site's route structure. It's recommended to avoid using special characters in these fields until a fix is implemented.
2. **Group Deletion**: Deleting a Group doesn't remove the associated coins from the database. While these coins won't be visible to site visitors, they remain in the backend. It's advisable to delete all coins within a group before deleting the group itself. A future update will address this, allowing for automatic deletion of coins when a group is removed.


## Technologies & Libraries

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Template Engine**: EJS
- **Authentication**: bcryptjs for password hashing
- **Session Management**: express-session with connect-mongodb-session
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv
- **Email Service**: node-mailjet
- **Development Tool**: nodemon for hot-reloading during development
